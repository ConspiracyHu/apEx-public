rekkrunchy
==========

This is my fork of rygs kkrunchy_k7 0.23a4/asm07, with patches.

Executable download: http://scene.org/file.php?file=%2Fresources%2Fcode%2Futils%2Frekkrunchy_030.zip&fileinfo

I renamed the project to avoid confusion with rygs original version.

So far everything works the same, except that pdb loading and size reports work again.
